# PROJECT OUTLINE

## Project Description:
The project's goal is to develop an Android app that allows users to create, manage and visualize saved campgrounds. Users can add information about the campground such as pictures, name, location, price, and description. The app will store this information locally on the user's device, and users will be able to select images for campgrounds from their device's photo gallery. The main view of the app will show a list of all the campgrounds that the user has created and allow users to expand the information and view the details of each campground.

## Problem Addressing:
Solve the need for campers’ lovers to organize and manage information about campgrounds they have visited or plan to visit.
Campers’ enthusiasts do not have an app where they can store campgrounds they want to visit or that they have already visited and want to recommend. This application provides a platform for creating, storing, and visualizing these campgrounds to improve their experience.

## Platform:
- Android Studio for app development.
- Local storage management for data persistence.
- Communication with the device's image gallery for image selection.

## Front-end Support:
- User interface (UI) development for creating campgrounds, visualizing campgrounds, and expanding information about them.
- Navigation components for switching between different screens and views.
- Implement UI elements for user input and image selection.
- Design layouts for the main campground list and detailed campground view.

## Back-end Support:
- Database management for storing campground data.
- Implementation of create and show operations for campgrounds.
- Integration with the device image manager for image selection and storage within the app.

## Functionality:
1. Campground Creation: Allow users to create a new campground with the following information:
   - Name
   - Location
   - Price
   - Description
   - Images (selected from the device gallery)

2. Campground Listing: Display a list of all campgrounds that the user has created.
   - Provide a thumbnail image, name, and location for each campground in the list.

3. Campground Details: When a campground in the list is selected, display detailed information about that campground, including all entered details and associated images.

Image Selection:
1. Implement a feature for users to select images for campgrounds from their device's image gallery.
2. Support image uploading and management.

## Design (Wireframes):
The app user interface will include the following screens:
1. Main screen with a list of campgrounds.
2. Campground creation screen with input fields for name, location, price, description, and image selection.
3. Campground detail screen with all campground information.
